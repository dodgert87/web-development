1) my plan for a portfolio web-site:

    On my portfolio website, there will be a top-down menu that includes my education and my career and projects my contact info from linked Emails and social media, and on the right, I will have my picture, and down from it I have a small bio, when you scroll down you get to the first section, my education with hyperlinks to certificate and education establishment, scrolling down, even more, you get to another section of the projects I realzid in my study, scrolling down more you get to see all the careers I held also with a hyperlink to references, and lastly scrolling down, even more, you get to the final section my hobby and in the bottom, you can find my contact info.

    the style I'm going to use is minimalist and bright colors. 

2) update :(adding a menu)
